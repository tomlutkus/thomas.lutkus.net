I'm Thomas. Brazilian by birth, shaped by years in Germany, and currently settled in Ireland with my family.

My faith in Christ is central to who I am. It informs my ethics, how I treat people, and the standard I hold my work to. I believe it's true, and I think truth is worth sharing.

I've spent over fifteen years in infrastructure engineering, mostly Linux, networking, and virtualization. I've worked across telecoms, logistics, e-commerce, and healthcare, from night shifts in a network operations center to architecting systems from scratch. The companies and titles changed, but the work stayed the same: make things work, keep them running, and leave them better than you found them.

I started this blog because I wanted a place to write honestly. The technical posts cover what I'm actually working on: Linux administration, Proxmox, Ansible, shell scripting, problems I've solved and how. The rest is whatever I'm thinking through: work ethics, privacy, technology and society, the occasional opinion that might not be popular.

No fluff, no engagement bait. I write what I learn and what I think.
