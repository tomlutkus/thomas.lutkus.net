Infrastructure engineer based in Ireland. 15+ years building and supporting Linux systems across enterprise environments.

I've worked at AT&T, IBM, BT, Zalando, HelloFresh, TomTom, and VMware. Currently focused on virtualization Linux and Virtualization (Proxmox, RHEL), automation (Ansible), and security compliance.

Pursuing RHCSA and RHCE certifications in 2026.

This blog covers:

- **Technical posts**: Linux administration, Ansible, Proxmox, shell scripting, problems I've solved.
- **Thinking posts**: Work ethics, privacy, technology and society, occasional philosophy with a Christian perspective.

I like to write what I learn and my thoughts. No fluff, no engagement bait.
