I've spent over fifteen years building and supporting Linux and network infrastructure. I've built teams from scratch, worn every hat there is, and written more internal documentation than I can count. But I never wrote publicly. Not because I had nothing to say, but because the timing wasn't right.

It's right now.

This blog exists because I want to put real work and real thinking out into the world. Technical posts about what I'm actually building: Linux, Proxmox, automation, networking. And posts about what I'm actually thinking: work ethics, privacy, technology, whatever I'm working through at the time.

We live in a moment where most content is either generated by machines or optimized for engagement. I think that makes honest writing more valuable, not less. I'm not interested in chasing algorithms or packaging takes for clicks. I'd rather write something worth reading once than something designed to be scrolled past a thousand times.

I should say the thing that matters most. I'm a Christian. My faith came later in life, but it became the foundation for everything else, how I treat people, the standards I hold my work to, and the way I see the world. I believe a carpenter from Galilee two thousand years ago is the answer to the big questions, and I'd invite anyone to look into what He said and why He became the most important person in history. I won't be subtle about that here, but I also won't be obnoxious about it. It's simply the truth as I understand it, and truth is worth sharing.

If any of that resonates, welcome. If not, stick around anyway. The technical content is solid and the opinions are free.
