Hi there! I'm an infrastructure engineer with 15+ years of experience building and supporting Linux and network infrastructure. I built a team from scratch, I'm a "wear all hats" guy at my current job. More importantly, I'm a husband and father.

This blog is for sharing my knowledge and experiences in the tech industry. It's also for writing thoughts and opinions. My hope is to express things which are meaningful and impactful. I also mean to write about technology and privacy.

I'm thrilled to write. I have been writing a lot of technical documentation for my teams in the places where I worked, but for the first time I feel that I'm in the right moment of my life to make public contributions. 

Especially in this moment in time where everyone is talking about AI and in which resentment towards the technology seems to be building up fast, I believe that people are, more than ever, challenged to step forward and contribute things full of soul and authenticity. It's also my hope to offer something humane and approachable in this sea of AI slop.

Since you are here reading this, I would also invite you to think about the big questions. Why do you exist? What's the meaning of life? A carpenter from Galilee two thousand years ago is the answer, and I invite you to look into it yourself and think consider what He said, and how and why He became the most important person in history. My Christian faith came late, but it's the foundation for my personal and work ethics: I treat everyone as having dignity inherent to them being made in the image of God, and I give the highest importance to treating everyone with the love and respect that entails. I hope that you'll stick around.

I'm happy that you are here and that you took the time to read this.
