I follow Christ, raise a family, and build infrastructure for a living, in that order. \
That order matters because it shapes how I approach everything else, the work I do and \
the standards I hold myself to. Fifteen years of Linux and networks taught me that the \
best systems, like the best lives, are built on solid foundations and kept simple. I'm \
opinionated, I'd rather be honest than polished, and I tend to think things through for \
myself rather than borrow someone else's conclusions. I need to understand something \
deeply before I make it mine. I write about infrastructure, automation, my own thoughts \
and opinions, and whatever else I'm working through. If you value simplicity, truth, and \
honest work, welcome. If not, stick around anyway, you might change your mind.
