&lt;p&gt;Now, we will be deploying an enterprise-grade lab. Therefore we need to think about how we do things in production: we can&amp;rsquo;t be clicking around and hoping for the best. This quickly compounds. We also need things to scale, to be idempotent (magic word for &amp;ldquo;always works the same&amp;rdquo;) and self-healing. As I see this series going right now, we will be iterating the design of our lab a little bit as we go, since there is always room for improving and learning. That being said, I have done some changes to Part 1 to keep things consistent with this new post, add some stuff and fix minor errors. You should check it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have some cool experience deploying and configuring a Proxmox cluster with High Availability and fully redundant Ceph in production. I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be cool to share my insights. Since I have been meaning to redeploy my lab on my laptop to test some things, I thought this is a good time. To start, this post will be about setting up the lab environment and install one Proxmox instance. I&amp;rsquo;m going to write a few other tutorials as I go. You are free to use the content here as you see fit. I would appreciate being credited, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
